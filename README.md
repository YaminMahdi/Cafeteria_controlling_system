## Getting Started
This is my second JAVA Project with DATABASE. The project is made in IntelliJ IDEA with XAMPP [MySQL DATABASE].

It is all about a Self Cafeteria System.

## Folder Structure
First you have to IMPORT library_management_system.sql file in MySQL localhost. Then just run "src\MainApp.java". 

The workspace contains three folders, where:

- 'src': the folder to maintain sources
- 'lib': the folder to maintain dependencies
- 'out': the folder of class file
